# Reference TweetNaCl

This repo is just MCCI's curated version of [TweetNaCl](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/), by Daniel Bernstein et al.

We deliberately keep it simple here. The files here are cloned from the distribution of 20140427:

* [`tweetnacl.h`](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/20140427/tweetnacl.h)

This repo is in the public domain, because the original code is in the public domain, and it has not been changed.

A related, [`mcci_tweetnacl`](https://github.com/mcci-catena/mcci_tweetnacl) contains additional material and generated wrappers for this code for use in embedded systems.
